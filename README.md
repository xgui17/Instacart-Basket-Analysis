<ol>
  <li>Order volumes are considerably higher during daytime hours on weekends (9 AM to 5 PM). Therefore, it is recommended that the company allocate more drivers during these peak hours by adjusting delivery fees. This would ensure sufficient driver availability and timely order deliveries, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
  <li>The majority of orders (~48%) are placed more than 7 days after the customer's last order.To encourage more frequent purchase, it is suggested that the company utilize targeted strategies to increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business. For example, coupons, discounts and free shipping can be offered to customers whose second order exceeds a certain amount within a week. </li>
  <li>Among the top 20 products, 14 (~75%) are organic. Organic products also have higher reorder rates compared to non-organic products. Given the growing demand for healthier food options, the company should consider increasing the visibility of organic products across its websites and mobile applications.</li>
  <li>The company may consider building a dynamic dashboard based on the treemap with regular updates. It can facilitate ongoing monitoring of overall sales conditions, streamline data storage and analysis, and improve decision making efficiency.</li>
