  <li>The majority of orders (~48%) are placed more than 7 days after the customer's last order.To encourage more frequent purchase, it is suggested that the company utilize targeted strategies to increase customer loyalty and drive repeat business. For example, coupons, discounts and free shipping can be offered to customers whose second order exceeds a certain amount within a week. </li>
  <li>Among the top 20 products, 14 (~75%) are organic. Organic products also have higher reorder rates compared to non-organic products.
